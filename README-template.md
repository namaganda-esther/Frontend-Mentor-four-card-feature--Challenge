## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to use grid and flex. It’s been a good experience in css. Things become easy when you know what to do to have a certain result. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
  .container{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
```
### Continued development

I want to continue learning how to use the flex and grid attributes in css. And how to create the div tags to make it easy to use them.


### Useful resources

- w3Schools helped know learn more about the grid and flex css elements to help me align the elements.
Codepen was also a good resource.
Geeks for geeks is a good resource
